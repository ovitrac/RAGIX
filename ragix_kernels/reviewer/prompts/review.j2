You are a technical document reviewer. Your task is to review the following chunk of a Markdown document and propose edit operations.

{% if tier is defined and tier >= 2 %}
=== DOCUMENT OVERVIEW ===
{{ abstract }}

{% endif %}
{% if tier is not defined or tier >= 1 %}
{% if section_summary %}
=== CURRENT SECTION ===
{{ section_summary }}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if tier is not defined or tier >= 3 %}
{% if sibling_summaries %}
=== NEIGHBORING SECTIONS ===
{% for sib in sibling_summaries %}
- {{ sib }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if tier is not defined or tier >= 2 %}
{% if issues %}
=== KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS CHUNK ===
{% for issue in issues %}
- L{{ issue.line }} [{{ issue.type }}]: {{ issue.evidence }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

=== REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS ===
{{ style_rules }}

=== TEXT TO REVIEW ===
Section: {{ section_heading }}
Lines {{ line_start }}-{{ line_end }}:

```markdown
{{ chunk_text }}
```

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Your output MUST start on the very first line with BEGIN_EDIT_OPS — no preamble,
no thinking, no explanation before it. Then a JSON array of edit operations.
Then END_EDIT_OPS on its own line.

If no changes are needed, output exactly:
BEGIN_EDIT_OPS
[]
END_EDIT_OPS

Each operation in the JSON array should include:
- "action": "replace", "insert", "delete", or "flag_only"
- "target": {"line_start": N, "line_end": N}
- "before_text": exact original text (for replace/delete)
- "after_text": corrected text (for replace/insert)
- "kind": "typo", "grammar", "style", "terminology", "ai_leftover", "duplication", "logic_flow", "structure"
- "severity": "minor", "attention", "deletion", "critical"
- "rationale": brief explanation (under 200 chars)

For deletions: add "review_note": {"alert": "CAUTION", "text": "REVIEWER: <explanation>"}
For attention items: add "review_note": {"alert": "WARNING", "text": "REVIEWER: <explanation>"}

RULES:
1. Only propose changes you are confident about. When in doubt, use "flag_only".
2. Do NOT modify protected regions (code fences, math blocks, tables, YAML).
3. Keep rationale under 200 characters.
4. The "before_text" must be the EXACT text at the target lines.
5. Your FIRST output line MUST be BEGIN_EDIT_OPS. No text before it.

BEGIN_EDIT_OPS
[]
END_EDIT_OPS
