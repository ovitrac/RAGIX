Your output MUST start on the very first line with one of:
- "[RVW]" if you found issues
- "No changes needed." if the text is correct

Do NOT output any preamble, thinking, or explanation before your answer.

For each issue, use exactly this format:

[RVW] action=replace
lines=<start>-<end>
before="<exact original text>"
after="<corrected text>"
rationale=<brief explanation>

Or for flagging without changing:

[RVW] action=flag_only
lines=<start>-<end>
rationale=<what the issue is>

Do NOT modify tables, code blocks, math expressions, or YAML front matter.
