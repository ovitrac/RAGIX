You are a senior technical reviewer. A previous attempt to generate edit operations for this Markdown chunk was rejected by the validation step.

=== REJECTION REASON ===
{{ rejection_reason }}

=== ORIGINAL TEXT (Lines {{ line_start }}-{{ line_end }}) ===
Section: {{ section_heading }}

```markdown
{{ chunk_text }}
```

{% if issues %}
=== KNOWN ISSUES ===
{% for issue in issues %}
- L{{ issue.line }} [{{ issue.type }}]: {{ issue.evidence }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

=== REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS ===
{{ style_rules }}

=== TASK ===
Generate a CONSERVATIVE set of edit operations for this chunk.

IMPORTANT: Given the previous rejection, be extra careful:
- Only propose changes you are absolutely certain about
- Prefer "flag_only" over actual modifications when uncertain
- Do NOT hallucinate content or claims
- Do NOT touch protected regions (code, math, tables, YAML)
- Verify line numbers carefully

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Wrap operations between BEGIN_EDIT_OPS and END_EDIT_OPS:

BEGIN_EDIT_OPS
[
  {
    "action": "replace|flag_only",
    "target": {"line_start": N, "line_end": N},
    "before_text": "<exact original text>",
    "after_text": "<corrected text>",
    "kind": "typo|grammar|style",
    "severity": "minor|attention",
    "rationale": "<brief explanation>"
  }
]
END_EDIT_OPS

If no safe changes can be made: BEGIN_EDIT_OPS [] END_EDIT_OPS
