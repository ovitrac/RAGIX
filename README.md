## **Mission**

**RAGIX** is a sovereign, fully-local, Claude-Code–style development assistant that has evolved into a complete multi-agent orchestration platform.

It combines:

- **Local LLM reasoning** (via Ollama: Mistral/Qwen/DeepSeek/Granite)
- **Multi-agent workflow execution** with dependency graphs
- **Hybrid retrieval** (BM25 + vector semantic search)
- **Production-grade monitoring** and resilience
- **Claude MCP integration** for seamless AI collaboration
- **Sandboxed execution** with safety policies

RAGIX's primary objective:

> **Make local LLMs behave like disciplined software engineers.**
> Without hallucinated facts, without remote calls, without blind trust.

All processing happens **100% on your machine**. Not a single token leaves it.

## **Core Capabilities**

### **Multi-Agent Workflows**

Define complex workflows with dependencies:

```python
from ragix_core import get_template_manager, GraphExecutor

# Use a pre-built template
manager = get_template_manager()
graph = manager.instantiate("bug_fix", {
    "bug_description": "TypeError in handler.py",
    "affected_files": "src/handlers/",
})

# Execute with streaming
async for event in executor.execute_streaming(agent_factory):
    print(f"[{event.event_type}] {event.node_id}")
```

**Built-in templates:**
- `bug_fix` - Locate, diagnose, fix, test
- `feature_addition` - Design, implement, test, document
- `code_review` - Quality and security review
- `refactoring` - Analyze, plan, refactor, verify
- `documentation` - Code analysis and doc generation
- `security_audit` - Static analysis and dependency checks
- `test_coverage` - Coverage analysis and test generation
- `exploration` - Codebase exploration and analysis

### **Hybrid Search (BM25 + Vector)**

Combine keyword and semantic search:

```python
from ragix_core import create_hybrid_engine, FusionStrategy

engine = create_hybrid_engine(
    index_path=Path(".ragix/index"),
    embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
)

results = engine.search(
    "database connection error",
    k=10,
    strategy=FusionStrategy.RRF,
)

for r in results:
    print(f"{r.file_path}:{r.name} (score: {r.combined_score:.3f})")
    print(f"  Source: {r.source}")  # 'bm25', 'vector', or 'both'
```

**Fusion strategies:**
- **RRF** - Reciprocal Rank Fusion (default)
- **Weighted** - Configurable BM25/vector balance
- **Interleave** - Round-robin merging
- **BM25 Rerank** - Vector search with BM25 reranking
- **Vector Rerank** - BM25 search with vector reranking

### **Production Monitoring**

```python
from ragix_core import get_health_checker, get_agent_monitor

# Health checks
checker = get_health_checker()
report = checker.get_status_report()
print(f"Status: {report['status']}")

# Agent monitoring
monitor = get_agent_monitor()
monitor.start_execution("exec_001", "Fix bug", "code")
monitor.record_tool_call("read_file", success=True, duration=0.1)
monitor.end_execution("exec_001", success=True, agent_type="code")
```

### **Resilience Patterns**

```python
from ragix_core import retry_async, RetryConfig, CircuitBreaker

# Retry with exponential backoff
@retry_async(RetryConfig(max_attempts=5, base_delay=1.0))
async def unreliable_call():
    return await api.request()

# Circuit breaker
breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30)
if breaker.is_allowed():
    try:
        result = await api.call()
        breaker.record_success()
    except Exception:
        breaker.record_failure()
```

### **AST Analysis & Code Metrics**

Professional-grade static analysis for Python and Java:

```bash
# Scan project and extract symbols
ragix-ast scan ./src --lang java

# Get code metrics (complexity, debt, maintainability)
ragix-ast metrics ./src

# Find complexity hotspots
ragix-ast hotspots ./src --top 20

# Search with AST query language
ragix-ast search ./src "type:class @Transactional"
ragix-ast search ./src "extends:BaseService"
```

```python
from ragix_core import build_dependency_graph, calculate_metrics

# Build dependency graph
graph = build_dependency_graph([Path("./src")])
cycles = graph.detect_cycles()
coupling = graph.get_coupling_metrics()

# Calculate code metrics
metrics = calculate_metrics(Path("./src"))
print(f"Technical debt: {metrics.total_debt_hours:.1f} hours")
print(f"Avg complexity: {metrics.avg_cyclomatic:.2f}")
```

### **Interactive Visualizations**

Three visualization types for dependency analysis:

```bash
# Force-directed dependency graph with package clustering
ragix-ast graph ./src --format html --output deps.html

# Dependency Structure Matrix (heatmap with cycles)
ragix-ast matrix ./src --level package --output matrix.html

# Radial ego-centric explorer
ragix-ast radial ./src --focal ClassName --levels 3 --output radial.html

# Live radial server (real-time exploration)
python -m ragix_unix.radial_server --path ./src --port 8090
```

**Features:**
- Package clustering with convex hulls
- Edge bundling for clarity
- Cycle detection (red cells in DSM)
- Auto-selection of highest-connectivity focal node
- Breadcrumb navigation for exploration history

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model (choose one)
ollama pull mistral          # Recommended: good balance
ollama pull qwen2.5          # Alternative: multilingual
ollama pull deepseek-coder   # Alternative: code-focused
```

#### 2. Install RAGIX

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ovitrac/RAGIX.git
cd RAGIX
pip install -e .
```

#### 3. Install the MCP SDK

```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

#### 4. Configure your environment

```bash
# Set the sandbox root to your project folder
export UNIX_RAG_SANDBOX="$HOME/my-project"

# Set the Ollama model
export UNIX_RAG_MODEL="mistral"

# Set safety profile (dev is recommended)
export UNIX_RAG_PROFILE="dev"
```

#### 5. Install RAGIX as an MCP server

```bash

mcp install MCP/ragix_mcp_server.py --name "RAGIX"
```

#### 6. Enable in Claude Desktop

1. Open **Claude Desktop**
2. Go to **Settings** → **MCP Servers**
3. Find **RAGIX** and toggle it **ON**
4. Restart Claude Desktop

### How to Use It

Once connected, you can ask Claude to help with your code. Claude will automatically use RAGIX tools when appropriate.

#### Example Conversations

**Finding code:**
```
You: Where is the database connection configured in my project?

Claude: I'll search your codebase for database configuration.
[Uses ragix_search to find relevant files]
I found the database configuration in src/config/database.py...
```

**Understanding code:**
```
You: Explain what the UserAuthentication class does

Claude: Let me read that file for you.
[Uses ragix_read_file to examine the code]
The UserAuthentication class handles login, logout, and session management...
```

**Fixing bugs:**
```
You: There's a TypeError in my handlers module, can you find and fix it?

Claude: I'll use a bug-fixing workflow to locate and fix this.
[Uses ragix_workflow with bug_fix template]
I found the issue: on line 42 of handlers.py, you're calling .lower()
on a None value. Here's the fix...
```

**Code review:**
```
You: Review the code in src/api/ for potential issues

Claude: I'll perform an automated code review.
[Uses ragix_workflow with code_review template]
I found 3 issues: 1) Missing input validation in endpoint X...
```

### Available Tools

When connected, Claude has access to these RAGIX tools:

| Tool | What It Does | When Claude Uses It |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| `ragix_chat` | Execute a reasoning step with shell commands | Complex analysis tasks |
| `ragix_search` | Find code using keywords + semantic search | "Where is X?", "Find all Y" |
| `ragix_read_file` | Read a specific file safely | "Show me file X", "What's in Y?" |
| `ragix_scan_repo` | Get project structure overview | "What files are in this project?" |
| `ragix_workflow` | Run multi-step automated workflows | Bug fixing, code review, refactoring |
| `ragix_templates` | List available workflow templates | "What workflows can you run?" |
| `ragix_health` | Check system status | Troubleshooting, status checks |

### Workflow Templates

Ask Claude to run these pre-built workflows:

| Template | What It Does | Example Request |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| `bug_fix` | Locate, diagnose, fix, and test bugs | "Fix the null pointer error in auth.py" |
| `feature_addition` | Design, implement, test new features | "Add a caching layer to the API" |
| `code_review` | Automated quality & security review | "Review the payment module" |
| `refactoring` | Identify and fix code smells | "Refactor the utils folder" |
| `documentation` | Generate/update documentation | "Document the API endpoints" |
| `security_audit` | Check for security vulnerabilities | "Audit the login system" |
| `test_coverage` | Analyze and improve tests | "Improve tests for user module" |
| `exploration` | Understand unfamiliar code | "Explain how the cache works" |

### What to Expect

**Response times:**
- Simple searches: 1-3 seconds
- File reading: < 1 second
- Workflow execution: 5-30 seconds (depends on complexity)

**Safety:**
- RAGIX runs in a **sandboxed environment** — it can only access files in your configured sandbox
- Destructive commands (like `rm -rf`) are **blocked by default**
- Git operations are **protected** — no force pushes or hard resets

**Limitations:**
- RAGIX uses a local LLM (Ollama) for its reasoning, which may be slower than cloud models
- Complex workflows may take longer on less powerful machines
- The local LLM quality affects RAGIX's internal reasoning (Claude's quality is unchanged)

### Troubleshooting

**Claude says "RAGIX not available":**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Check if MCP server is installed
mcp list

# Reinstall if needed
mcp install MCP/ragix_mcp_server.py --name "RAGIX"
```

**Searches return no results:**
```bash
# Make sure sandbox is set to your project
echo $UNIX_RAG_SANDBOX

# Should point to your project folder
export UNIX_RAG_SANDBOX="/path/to/your/project"
```

**"Permission denied" errors:**
```bash
# Check your safety profile
echo $UNIX_RAG_PROFILE

# Use 'dev' for normal development
export UNIX_RAG_PROFILE="dev"
```

**Test the connection:**
```bash
# Run the demo to verify everything works
python examples/claude_demo.py
```

### Quick Reference Card

```bash
# === SETUP ===
ollama pull mistral
pip install -e .
pip install "mcp[cli]"
mcp install MCP/ragix_mcp_server.py --name "RAGIX"

# === ENVIRONMENT ===
export UNIX_RAG_SANDBOX="$HOME/my-project"
export UNIX_RAG_MODEL="mistral"
export UNIX_RAG_PROFILE="dev"

# === TEST ===
python examples/claude_demo.py

# === USE WITH CLAUDE ===
# Just ask naturally:
# "Search for authentication code"
# "Fix the bug in handlers.py"
# "Review the API module"
```

## **LLM Backends**

RAGIX supports multiple LLM backends. Choose based on your privacy requirements and desired quality.

### Backend Comparison

| Backend | Sovereignty | Quality | Speed | Cost | Privacy |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| 🟢 **Ollama** | SOVEREIGN | Good | Depends on HW | Free | 100% local |
| 🔴 **Claude** | CLOUD | Excellent | Fast | API costs | Data sent to Anthropic |
| 🔴 **OpenAI** | CLOUD | Excellent | Fast | API costs | Data sent to OpenAI |

### 🟢 Ollama Backend (SOVEREIGN - Default)

**100% local execution. No data leaves your machine.**

This is the default and recommended backend for sensitive codebases.

```bash
# Configuration
export RAGIX_LLM_BACKEND="ollama"
export UNIX_RAG_MODEL="mistral"  # or: qwen2.5, deepseek-coder, granite

# Install and run
ollama pull mistral
ollama serve
```

```python
from ragix_core import OllamaLLM, create_llm_backend

# Direct instantiation
llm = OllamaLLM("mistral")

# Or via factory
llm = create_llm_backend("ollama", model="mistral")

# Check sovereignty
print(llm.sovereignty)  # "sovereign" - ✅ safe
```

**Supported models:**
- `mistral` - Recommended, good balance of speed and quality
- `qwen2.5` - Good multilingual support
- `deepseek-coder` - Optimized for code
- `granite` - IBM's code model
- `llama3.2` - Meta's latest
- `codellama` - Code-specialized Llama

### 🔴 Claude Backend (CLOUD)

> ⚠️ **SOVEREIGNTY WARNING** ⚠️
>
> This backend sends your prompts and code to Anthropic's servers.
> Your code leaves your machine. Use only if you accept this trade-off.

**Best reasoning quality, especially for complex code tasks.**

```bash
# Configuration
export RAGIX_LLM_BACKEND="claude"
export RAGIX_CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Install dependency
pip install anthropic
```

```python
from ragix_core import ClaudeLLM, create_llm_backend

# Direct instantiation
llm = ClaudeLLM("claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# Or via factory
llm = create_llm_backend("claude", model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# Check sovereignty
print(llm.sovereignty)  # "cloud" - ⚠️ data leaves your machine
```

**Supported models:**
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` - Recommended, best balance
- `claude-opus-4-20250514` - Most capable, higher cost
- `claude-haiku-3-20240307` - Fastest, lowest cost

**When to use Claude backend:**
- You need the highest quality code reasoning
- Your code is not sensitive/proprietary
- You're working on open-source projects
- Speed is more important than privacy

---

### 🔴 OpenAI Backend (CLOUD)

> ⚠️ **SOVEREIGNTY WARNING** ⚠️
>
> This backend sends your prompts and code to OpenAI's servers.
> Your code leaves your machine. Use only if you accept this trade-off.

**ChatGPT models, widely used and well-documented.**

```bash
# Configuration
export RAGIX_LLM_BACKEND="openai"
export RAGIX_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Install dependency
pip install openai
```

```python
from ragix_core import OpenAILLM, create_llm_backend

# Direct instantiation
llm = OpenAILLM("gpt-4o")

# Or via factory
llm = create_llm_backend("openai", model="gpt-4o")

# Check sovereignty
print(llm.sovereignty)  # "cloud" - ⚠️ data leaves your machine
```

**Supported models:**
- `gpt-4o` - Recommended, multimodal
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Faster, cheaper
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Previous generation
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fastest, cheapest

                    Retrieval stays local,
                    but LLM calls go to cloud
```

### Programmatic Backend Selection

```python
from ragix_core import create_llm_backend, get_backend_from_env

# Option 1: Explicit selection
llm_local = create_llm_backend("ollama", model="mistral")      # 🟢 Sovereign
llm_claude = create_llm_backend("claude")                       # 🔴 Cloud
llm_openai = create_llm_backend("openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")  # 🔴 Cloud

# Option 2: From environment variables
llm = get_backend_from_env()  # Uses RAGIX_LLM_BACKEND

# Check what you're using
print(f"Backend: {llm.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Model: {llm.model_name}")
print(f"Sovereignty: {llm.sovereignty}")  # "sovereign" or "cloud"

# All backends have the same interface
response = llm.generate(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful coding assistant.",
    history=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain this code..."}]
)
```
