      "final_answer": "Here is the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity are two different software metrics that measure distinct aspects of a program's structure and maintainability.\n\n**Cyclomatic Complexity**: This metric, also known as McCabe's complexity, measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program. It is calculated by counting the number of decisions (if/else statements) and loops in a function or module. A higher cyclomatic complexity score indicates that there are more possible execution paths through the code, which can make it harder to understand and maintain.\n\n**Cognitive Complexity**: This metric measures the perceived difficulty or \"busyness\" of a piece of code. It takes into account not only the number of statements and expressions but also their nesting depth, complexity of logic, and overall readability. Cognitive complexity is often used to evaluate the ease with which developers can comprehend and modify the code.\n\nHere are some key differences between the two metrics:\n\n* **Focus**: Cyclomatic complexity focuses on the structural complexity of a program, while cognitive complexity focuses on the perceived difficulty or \"busyness\" of the code.\n* **Calculation**: Cyclomatic complexity is calculated by counting decisions and loops, whereas cognitive complexity is typically evaluated through manual review or using specialized tools.\n* **Purpose**: The primary goal of cyclomatic complexity is to identify potential issues with maintainability and testability, while cognitive complexity aims to help developers understand the overall \"difficulty\" of a piece of code.\n\nIn summary, while both metrics can provide valuable insights into software quality, they measure different aspects of a program's structure and maintainability.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9\n}\n```",
