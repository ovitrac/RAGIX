## What's Ready for Use

### For Local LLM Development (Ollama)
```bash
# Start unix-rag-agent.py with updated system prompt
python3 unix-rag-agent.py

# Agent now knows about SWE commands:
# - rt open path:line
# - rt scroll path +/-
# - rt grep-file pattern path
# - rt edit path start end << 'EOF' ... EOF
# - rt insert path line << 'EOF' ... EOF
```

### For Human Development
```bash
# Use SWE tools directly
./rt.sh open src/module.py:123
./rt.sh scroll src/module.py +
./rt.sh grep-file "pattern" src/module.py

# Or traditional Unix-RAG style
grep -R -n "pattern" src/
sed -n '100,150p' src/module.py
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Run test suite
chmod +x test_swe_tools.sh
./test_swe_tools.sh
```

---

## Next Steps (For User)

### Immediate Actions Available

   # Review new documentation
   cat EXAMPLES_SWE.md
   cat EXAMPLES_UNIX_RAG.md
   cat SWE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   ```

2. **Test the Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Run automated tests
   ./test_swe_tools.sh

   # Try commands manually
   ./rt.sh open ragix_tools.py:641
   ./rt.sh grep-file "def open_window" ragix_tools.py
   ```

3. **Commit Changes** (when ready)

   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(swe): implement SWE-Agent style tooling (v0.4)

   - Add navigation commands: open, scroll
   - Add search command: grep-file
   - Add edit commands: edit, insert
   - Update system prompt for LLM integration
   - Add comprehensive documentation (24 examples)
   - Add automated test suite (9 tests)
   - Maintain 100% backward compatibility

"
   ```

4. **Optional: Tag Release**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "RAGIX v0.4.0 - SWE Tooling"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

## Known State at Shutdown

### Temporary Files Created
```
.ragix_view_state.json    # Created during testing (git-ignored)
/tmp/ragix_swe_test.txt   # Test file (cleaned up)
```

### Backup Files Created
```
*.bak files created during edit/insert operations (git-ignored)
```

### Ollama Status
Not started during this session. LLM integration tested via system prompt update only.

---

## Integration Points

### With unix-rag-agent.py
✅ System prompt updated with full SWE command documentation
✅ Ready for Ollama local LLMs (Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek)
✅ JSON action protocol unchanged (backward compatible)

### With MCP (Future Phase 7)
⏸️ Framework ready but not implemented (out of scope)
⏸️ Can be added later without breaking changes

### With Existing Tools
✅ rt find, rt grep, rt stats, etc. — All unchanged
✅ Full backward compatibility maintained
